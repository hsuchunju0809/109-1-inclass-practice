## Your code

```{r}

ages_chr
```

```{r}
unique(ages_chr)
```

```{r}
table(ages_chr)
```

```{r}
ages_fct1 <- 
  factor(
    ages_chr
  )
```

```{r}
ages_chr
ages_fct1
```

```{r}
ages_fct2 <- 
  factor(
    ages_chr,
    levels = c("4以下","5-10","11-15")
  )
ages_fct2
```

```{r}
table(ages_fct1)
table(ages_fct2)
```

```{r}
ages_fct2[[3]] #4以下
ages_fct2[[6]] #5-10
ages_fct2[[3]] > ages_fct2[[6]]
```

```{r}
ages_fct3 <-

    levels = c("4以下","5-10","11-15"),
    ordered = T
  )
ages_fct3
```

```{r}
ages_fct3[[3]] #4以下
ages_fct3[[6]] #5-10
ages_fct3[[3]] > ages_fct3[[6]]
ages_fct3[[6]] < "11-15" # 也可以用文字寫下levels中有的分類
```

```{r}

ages_fct2_order
# 也可以
ages_fct2_order = as.ordered(ages_fct2)

# 忘了告訴電腦呈現順序是"11-15","5-10","4以下"
